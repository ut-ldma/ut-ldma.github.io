### Flush + Reload Cache Timing Attacks

The gym environment described in Part 1 does not include the flush instruction in the environment, as a result, it will
not be able to find flush+reload attacks commonly used. Even though the cache simulator has the interface for flush instruction,
the gym environment did not expose the flush to the ```action_space()```, in this excercise, we aim at extending the gym environment to incorporate the flush action into the gym environment. We directly modify the [```src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py```](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab/blob/main/src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py).

We use a flag [```flush_inst```](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab/blob/main/src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py#L100) to indicate whether we want to include flush instruction for the attacker, by default it is not enabled.


### Modify the ```action_space``` to Incorporate Flush Action

First, the original [```action_space```](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab/blob/main/src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py#L172) does not include the encodings for flush action, we need to extend the size of the action_space to include necessary encoding for flushing different attacker addresses, this is defined [here](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab/blob/main/src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py#L177).

### Modify the Action Parser ```parse_action()``` 

Second, after we increase the action space size, we still need to decode/parse the action so that we know which encoding corresponds to flushing which address. This is defined [here](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab/blob/main/src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py#L441). Once [```is_flush```](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab/blob/main/src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py#L446) is set 1, it means the action correspond to a flush instruction which flushes the [address](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab/blob/main/src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py#L445).

### Perform the Flush Instruction in ```step()```

Finally, even if we know what the action means, we still need to actually invoke proper [cache simulator's API](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab/blob/main/src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py) in the [```step()```](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab/blob/main/src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py?plain=1#L204) of the cache environment. This is an coding exercise, please fill in the proper API [here](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab/blob/main/src/cache_guessing_game_env_impl.py?plain=1#L295).

### Train the Modified Env to Explore Flush+Reload Attack

Once the flush instruction is included, please use the following command to launch the training.

Go to torchrl directory.
```
(py38) $ cd /lab/src/rlmeta
```

Please use the following to launch the training (```hpca_ae_exp_4_3``` is a configuration that require flush instruction.)

```
(py38) $ python /lab/src/torchrl/train_ppo_attack.py env_config=hpca_ae_exp_4_3
```

Once the return is close to 1, please use the following to sample the attack.

```
(py38) $ /lab/src/torchrl/sampling_trajectories.py --saved_path=saved_ppo_attack-exp0 --num-rollouts=1
```
Which it will generate the attack sequence.
